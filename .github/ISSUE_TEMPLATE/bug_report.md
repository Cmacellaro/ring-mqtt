### PLEASE READ THIS FIRST ###
If you are using the Ring Devices Addon for Home Assistant, and the issue you are reporting is related to installing, configuring or operating the script underneath that platform, you should probably not be opening an issue on this page, but rather on the Ring Devices Addon page:
https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt-ha-addon

** Describe the bug **
A clear and concise description of the issue.  Please enter a brief summary of the issue in the title above as well.

**Debug Logs**
Nearly the only way to effectively troubleshoot most issues is to review the logs, without this, we'll mostly just be guessing at the problem.  Please run the script with DEBUG=ring-* enabled (note this is enabled by default for the addon and Docker) and post any relevant output here, or, if you are uncomfortable posting them publicly, which I certainly understand, you can send them, or a link to downloda them, to my personal email which is the same as my github username at gmail.
