## Description
The ring-mqtt project acts as a bridge between alarm, smart lighting and camera devices sold by Ring LLC and an MQTT broker thus allowing any automation tools that can leverage the open standards based MQTT protocol to monitor and control these devices.  The project also supports video streaming by providing an RTSP gateway service that allows any media client supporting the RTSP protocol to connect to a Ring camera livestream or to play back recorded events (Ring Protect subscription required for event recording playback).  Please review the full list of [supported devices and features](#supported-devices-and-features) for more information on current capabilities.

For more information please see the [detailed documentation](https://github.com/tsightler/ring-mqtt/wiki) available on the project wiki page.
